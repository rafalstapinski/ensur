(Current prototype works)

A web app to anonymously and securely transmit messages to peers.

The client is in charge of creating users, encrypting, and sending messages. Nodes can be spun up store encrypted messages, distribute data to clients, and among themselves to prevent any possible downtime. New users can be made on the client side at will to create disposable accounts, and can be exported to be available on multiple devices. All private cryptographic data is only available to the client and never reaches a node.
